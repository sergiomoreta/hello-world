# hello-world
## Introduction
This is my first repository, created as an introduction to Git and GitHub. That's why it's traditionally called Hello World.

### Markdown
Here I'm writing some Markdown syntax to explore some of its features.
To see how a list is created, I can use:
* Asterix, i.e. a
* Star character

Ordered lists are simply created by writing out the numbers manually (unlike wikitext markup).
1. The first item goes here.
2. The second item goes here. Note that this GitHub editor automatically generated the next numbered item.
